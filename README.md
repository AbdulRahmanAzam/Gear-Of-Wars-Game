# Introduction
This is a thrilling 2D action game that puts players in the mindset of
intense combat scenarios. This game is going to have different
characters and even different weapons and whenever the game is
leveling up the difficulty level is also increasing. There are
different enemies which are spawned according to the difficulty.

# Problem Statement
Many action games lack depth and challenge, often relying on
repetitive gameplay and predictable enemy behavior. It is very
difficult to make different maps of the game. As each map is
according to the difficulty level. This game asks a user to enter
username and stores their high scores which is very difficult to
make as it requires filing for this purpose.

# Proposed Solution
To Tackle the Problem, we are using SFML library. By focusing on
fast-paced gunplay and strategic combat. The inclusion of health
bars for both enemies and the player add an extra layer of strategy,
requiring players to carefully manage their health while taking
down enemies. This game delivers an intense and immersive
gameplay experience. Moreover, the Player is having the jetpack
with it which will decrease whenever the player is flying and
jetpack will refill automatically whenever the layer is not flying. In
this way we make higher challenges and depth in the game.
